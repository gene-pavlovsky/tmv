1.1.3 on Tue, 06 Feb 2007 02:14:42 +0300
  bin/tmv.sh: Fixed bug with files containing '\' confusing read.
  bin/tmv.sh: Strip trailing slashes from pathnames, fixing annoying
    behaviour when bash adds trailing slashes to directories when
    using tab completion.
  bin/tmv.sh: Fixed bug with files starting with '-' confusing dirname.
  bin/tmv-strip.sh: Escape '[' characters (fixes an annoying bug).
  bin/tmv.sh: Renamed '-m|--manual' option to '-h|--hand-edit'
    (consistent with my other project ova's ova-sed option). Old
    option name still works, but is deprecated.

1.1.2 on Mon, 29 Aug 2005 13:25:56 +0400
  NEW: bin/tmv-l.sh
  bin/tmv-l.sh: Convert pathnames to lower-case.

  bin/tmv-strip.sh: Don't use the 'g' option to the sed's 's' command
  bin/tmv.sh: Permit to do manual-only editing (in earlier versions
    tmv would exit saying 'no transformations have been specified').
  bin/tmv-strip.sh: Fixed some bullshit caused by shell's gross
    inconsistency. Damn shell just sucks.

1.0.5 on Fri, 12 Dec 2003 02:32:32 +0300

  NEW: README
  README: Written some documentation (should be enough).
  NEW: AUTHORS
  bin/tmv.sh: Removed '--force' option, always use mv with '-f' (because
    '-i' is pointless when reading from pipe).
  bin/tmv.sh: Added '--backup' option to pass '-b' to mv (GNU mv).
  install: remove prefix if empty on uninstall

1.0.1 on Fri, 28 Nov 2003 02:22:06 +0300

    large deal of functionality removed.

0.9.5 on Mon, 24 Nov 2003 19:02:50 +0300
  bin/tmv.sh Several '--pipe=CMD' options can be used; commands will be
    executed in the same sequence as they appear on the command line.

0.9.4 on Mon, 24 Nov 2003 18:47:35 +0300
  bin/tmv.sh Added '--force' option (remove existing destination files and
    never prompt the user).
  bin/tmv.sh Fixed a bug when file's dirnames were also transformed causing
    mv to fail.

0.9.3 on Mon, 24 Nov 2003 17:52:40 +0300
  bin/tmv.sh Don't interpret first non-option argument as sed script if no
    '-e/-f' specified (this was so in earlier versions).
  bin/tmv.sh Added several transform modes:
    'dd conv=(lcase|ucase)' support via '--lcase/--ucase' options
    'iconv -f FROM -t TO' support via '--iconv=FROM:TO' option
    arbitrary processing support with via '--pipe=COMMAND' option

  bin/tmv.sh Allow for multiple sed scripts via '-e' and '-f' options.
